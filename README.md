Data Analysis exercise from Kaggle ECML/PKDD 15: Taxi Trajectory Prediction (I)
For data accessment, download from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pkdd-15-predict-taxi-service-trajectory-i/data

The data analysis was performed in google colab, using Python. 
A description of the training dataset is given in the head of the file, including the project goal.

Only a sample from the entire dataset was used for data analysis, due to memory limitations. 

Since this data analysis was not submitted to kaggle, the 'test' file was not predicted. But for the models evaluation, we used 30% of the analyzed dataset as test.

Note: the ploted maps are not shown in github, so for better visualization access the colab file.
